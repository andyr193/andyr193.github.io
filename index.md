# Andaleeb Rahman
I am a researcher at the [Tata-Cornell Institute for Agriculture and Nutrition (TCI)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftci.cornell.edu&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHeuZCo33MzmeLx7jsgWyaYRXIKXA), situated within the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics & Management, Cornell University. 

Currently, I am working on a book project, *Future of India's social welfare programs,* to be published by Palgrave Macmillan. 

My research on identity questions our current understanding around diversity, segregation, and its effect on development outcomes in India.
