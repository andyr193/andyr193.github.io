**Outreach**

I have worked on multiple policy reports and participated in dialogues at the intersection of research and practice. 

At the Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS), Bangalore, I was involved in multiple projects looking at climate adaptation, disaster risk relocation and urban food insecurity, such as:

- Status report on vulnerabilities and risks arising out of climate change and how households responded to these changes [[link](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.assar.uct.ac.za%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimage_tool%2Fimages%2F138%2FSouth_Asia%2FSouth%20Asia%20RDS%20full%20report_update.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFAiJwKZriracRVE5ucdOQ-EwxSYw)]
- Contributions to survey design and conceptualization behind understanding the economic implications of the disaster induced resettlement. [[link](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fiihs.co.in%2Fknowledge-gateway%2Fsite-reports-iiiiiiiv%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF5QSg2EliH2TlK_H6enZ0QWMCigw)]
- Helped design the study and contributed to understanding the nature of food insecurity at a city scale for the *Hungry Cities* project.

As a part of my outreach work with the Tata-Cornell Institute (TCI), I organized policy dialogues:

- Related to budgeting for nutrition in collaboration with the *National Institute for Public Finance and Policy* (NIPFP), New Delhi. 
- On how to make agriculture nutrition sensitive in Bihar in collaboration with the *Asian Development Research Institute* (ADRI), Patna.
