I&#39;m a researcher at the <a href="https://www.tci.cornell.edu/">Tata-Cornell Institute for Agriculture and Nutrition (TCI) </a>, situated within the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics & Management, Cornell University.

Currently, I am working on a book project, *Future of India's social welfare programs,* to be published by Palgrave Macmillan. 

My research on identity questions our current understanding around diversity, segregation, and its effect on development outcomes in India.
