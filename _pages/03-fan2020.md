I co-authored this report at the Tata-Cornell Institute (TCI). This is the first in a series of such reports which addresses various issues around food, agriculture, and nutrition (FAN). FAN 2020 focuses on SDG 2: Moving to Zero Hunger and how agriculture could be leveraged for it. 

The uniqueness of this report comes from the utlization of a rich spatial and temporal data on rural India. An illustration of which is shown below and details around the database here. Based upon our analysis, we also provide multiple policy measures to achieve the objective of no hunger. Please explore the report.

Comments, suggestions, and potential for collaborations are most welcome.
